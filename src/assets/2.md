#### ﻿INTRO
## *October, 24th 2018*


I have been infatuated by the approachability and ubiquitousness of JavaScript for the last year, getting my hands and ears in all books, articles and podcasts I can. Being a sound designer by trade, my mind goes immediately to 'how can I use it for audio?', and it was no different here.

My research is a bit of a rabbit hole of libraries, approaches and blooming technologies, and I’ll try to summarize what I’ve found so far.

I will then go through each one of these with code examples and a deeper dive into what makes each of these technologies fun, and distinct.

*This is also the base material for a talk I will be giving soon in my local JavaScript meetup*.

#### WHAT IS OUT THERE




**WebAudio**

The WebAudio API (WAA) is a lot of fun to use, if a little hairy at times, and felt like a very interesting avenue of research. The documentation found on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) is pretty good, but some of the most sophisticated examples are to be found elsewhere in the wild.

Some users might find that calling it 'fun' is just not accurate: there are certain parts of it, in its [low-level design](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/), that can be a little frustrating. Turning these optimized but clunky at times syntax into sweeter, more forgiving API's is what most libraries attempt to do.

The WAA works by creating an AudioContext, not unlike when handling canvas in JS, and adding nodes that are chained together. One can see this as a modular studio, and you have a bunch of cables at hand to plug it all together. Oscillators, effects, splitters & mergers, gainer, panner, filters, sample player - the bread and butter is all there out of the box. The user is expected to assemble these into higher constructs: for example, in order to put together a mixer, one should chain mergers from different source nodes, and add gains and panners to each ‘channel’.

It is the base of pretty much all else out there, with some libraries building on top of the HTML5 audio capabilities.  



**Tone.js**

Improving on the WAA's usability, and using a more musical language, is [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/). This project expands the otherwise dry WAA into a more expressive tool - at least for me, and for other musically trained folks, I’d say. While the WAA will use milliseconds as its unit of time, Tone.js exposes time signatures, intervals, as well as super handy note names (A, G#, etc) instead of frequency values. The documentation is pretty dope, and I love the font they use, [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata). So, extra points, right?

Things like polyphonic synths, sequencers and more complex sample players are ready for you to customize, skipping the slower first steps encountered when using vanilla WAA.  



**Howler.js**

[Howler](https://howlerjs.com/)'s scope is rather broad, and builds on top of the WAA by pulling off some neat tricks: for starters, it attempts to be as compatible as possible when it comes to file formats/codecs used - there are HTML5 fallbacks for that. I really dig the idea of audio sprites Howler implements, in which one file will hold several samples and the user gets to 'slice' it by setting start and end points - that means less server requests if a little more loading time. Makes me think of how the [OP-1](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-1) by Teenage Engineering deals with it's drum samples. And, of course, how image sprites work in web and game development.

Another really cool feature that tickles the game sound designer that I am, is that it has spatial audio out of the box.  



**Bap**

This one is a very cool, if a little more specific, [library](http://bapjs.org/) - this guy went ahead and brought the paradigm behind programming [MPC's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akai_MPC) to the web! We're talking a ticks-per-second time scheduling and the kit>pattern>note notion when writing code for it. Something that makes the whole system very humanized and upbeat (got it?) is that when sequencing, you write your parts and name them, the final arrangement being a list of the names. Fun to rearrange! And it allows tempo changes pretty painlessly.

It uses Tuna.js (not Tone, see below) for its bundled effects.

If anything, it gets extra points for the creator's evident inspiration and respect for the late genius [J.Dilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agl1TgVfls0).  



**Pizzicato.js**

This [library](https://alemangui.github.io/pizzicato/) has been around for a while, and is still actively developed. It has a lot of fun synthesis and sample playback features, and I really dig the sound effects too - I think the creator is a guitar player, since the paradigm for the effects is very much guitar pedal-oriented: dub delay, tremolo, quadrafuzz, all remind me of a line of Boss pedals connected together.

The documentation is thorough, and the examples sound great.

It feels like a great library to get to work on stuff real fast - for example, the syntax for getting sound from the microphone is so simple and clean, I would say the creator has this approachability in mind for the project.  



**WAAX**

[WAAX](http://hoch.github.io/WAAX/) is part of the creator's doctoral thesis at [CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/) (a big deal, for sure!), and has not seen updates since 2014 - which is not necessarily bad, it might be the creator felt it has gone as far as it should.

This library has a really nifty UI to go with, very much [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/)-esque. It has cool implementations of the WAA, like splitting the signal or dealing with ASDR envelopes, made simpler and more intuitive. The idea seems to be 'chain all things' which feels sleek and straightforward.

I must admit I haven't done much with it, so I'll use the deep dive as an excuse to put together something, specially when it comes to a cool interface.  



**I Dropped My Phone The Screen Cracked (or simply Cracked)**

Long name here, I know - the overly complex title betrays the simplicity in the API of this [library](http://billorcutt.github.io/i_dropped_my_phone_the_screen_cracked/). The author refers to the way each method is chained as the ways CSS selectors work, which I find weird :)

The idea is pretty sweet, just dot chain all things, like a modular synth. It makes me think of the simplicity of [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/). The same way that PD can make subpatches by encapsulating functionality under the hood, Cracked has handy macro-ing methods, allowing you a similar way of abstracting chain you find yourself reusing.

The documentation seems unassuming at first, but it's actually really well put together. When looking for specific API's, you're taken to a brief description and then linked over to the code lines where that implementation happens. I like this 'peek inside' approach.

My kudos for adding shuffle, chords and scales in such a transparent way.  



**WebPD**

This [web implementation](https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd) of Pure Data on your web app is promising, but doesn't have a functioning interface analog, it seems. No biggie, since you can use the NexusUI library, for example, or roll your own.

Pure Data, if you're not familiar, is a signal processing piece of software, going from more low level aspects of audio manipulation and synthesis to video synthesis and some other out-there libraries. It's all visual, you patch these boxes together with 'cables', making up for a very interesting way to get started into programming without writing code as one would expect, line by line.

I'm a long time user and fan of PD. I started on it because I couldn't afford [Max/MSP](Max/MSP) back then (around 2005). I have a lot to thank it for. I'll do some digging into the WebPD implementation of Pure Data and collect the results in this log.

*If you know and love Pure Data, do yourself a favor and go check out [Automatonism](https://www.automatonism.com/).*

#### HONORABLE MENTIONS




**FMOD in beta!**

Indeed, FMOD, the industry standard for Unity middleware (alongside Wwise), has a [beta](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/28454-fmod-studio-api-now-available-for-html5/) for implementation on the web.  



**Pico.js**

This is [bonkers](https://mohayonao.github.io/pico.js/), a very MML-like implementation of sequencing, kinda arcane and hard to read - but the demo on the project's page is pure FM love! Does not intend to make the implementation exactly easier, but instead cross-platform, including Node.js.

Coding FM synthesis like that kinda makes my head hurt.  



**Tuna.js**

A [sound effects library](https://github.com/Theodeus/tuna) for the WAA, it appears elsewhere in the world of audio libraries for the web. Given its specificity, it comes in as an honorable mention. Well put together, it provides classic effects (notably a take on the Moog filter), so that you don't have to start from scratch next time you want to code your massive analog bassline :)  



**NexusUI**

This is a very unique [project](http://nexus-js.github.io/ui/) - it aims to provide musical software interface elements only, so that you can control your code handled by one of the above projects, for example. Uses HTML5, and sprinkles some helper methods to control your audio (random, drunk, etc). Things like the sequencer, while belonging to the presentational layer, are of course more than that, in that it helps your hand in managing code and structuring your API.

It's just a simple .js file, super easy to get started. The project is kinda active (last commit about 5 months ago, May 2018).

Cool to see a very specific need of web audio developers be meet in such an elegant way.  



**Gibber.audio.lib**

Ever heard of [Algorave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave)? It's bananas. [Gibber](https://gibber.cc/), the audiovisual coding environment famous for being a staple of the scene, has a [JavaScript library](https://github.com/charlieroberts/gibber.audio.lib) that follows the same ideas of the original web app.

Because I've never gone deep into it, I can say much about this one, only that the support for [Soundfonts](http://www.synthfont.com/links_to_soundfonts.html) sounds pretty awesome. Soundfonts can have a sort of hokey sound that can be fun to mess around with :)

#### MY VIEWS




My only beef, after a full year of looking into it, is that a lot of the demos and use cases portrayed are in the realm of ‘toy projects’, with a few exceptions. Two of these exceptions that come to mind are Ableton’s lovely ‘learning music’ project - an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and WebAudio (via Tone.js) app with the functionality I was hoping to find more abundantly - as well as [Marabu](https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/marabu), a tracker created by [neauoire](https://github.com/hundredrabbits). It is a fork of [Soundbox](http://sb.bitsnbites.eu/) by [Marcus Geelnard](http://www.bitsnbites.eu/), and does a ‘render’ pass before playback - a different kind of music-writing than I'm used to, but indeed a tool and not a toy. I'll definitely touch back on these tools in later posts.

I'm laying these opinions bare in the hopes of creating momentum for myself and turning my above-mentioned scribbled notes into a real-life tool for musicians. For example, while turning your WAA-based creations into MIDI to be ported over to your DAW of choice is not unheard of, it's definitely not a given. Tone.js uses a [tool](https://tonejs.github.io/MidiConvert/) to convert MIDI to JSON and allow some interoperability there, but I see a serious music tool as having that out of the box, no two ways about it. Rendering to wav in high resolutions? Has to be there too. Ok, rant over :)
